## About Voxie

Voxie is the world’s first conversational commerce platform for Business to Consumer brands. We’re building the future of communication by helping brands build relationships with their customers through conversation (SMS to start). We’re venture backed, launched mid-2018 and are powering conversations for some of the world’s largest brands like Danone, Unilever, Lululemon, and Mars while helping new-emerging brands go-to-market faster using the Voxie platform.

We’re on a mission to redefine how brands connect with their customers in meaningful ways that don’t involve spam and canned BS. This is challenging work but our team of passionate, creative, problem-solvers makes the journey exciting! 

We put customers first, win and work as a team and are results-oriented (we work smart).  We’re biased towards action and are eternal optimists.  Those are the values that define who we are and create the foundation of what we’re building.
